### Features:

* Matrix creasion by passing in C-style array, std::array, or std::vector. Supports valid manual dimension sizing

* Arithmetic or non-arithmetic data

* Basic comparison operations == and !=

* Arithmetic operations for arithmetic matrices (+ - * /)

* Matrix.print()

* The << operator (it performs the same task as Matrix.print())

* Indexing using (i, j), with assignment capabilities (using the referenced item)

* Matrix.Transpose()

* dotProduct(matrix1, matrix2)
